Early this year J. decided that he will end our shared path here and fully focus on Gorephilia. No hard feelings, only gratitude and respect to J. for the past years. Myriad hails!!!\n\nAlso huge thanks to CDF and Dark Descent for inviting us to the U.S. We had a killer time. Special thanks to Matt and the guys from Spectral Voice for your hospitality and help!\n\nStarting next year J. Lilja will be our new guitarist.\n\nPhoto by kvlt photography",
