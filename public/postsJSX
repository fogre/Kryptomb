  <p>It's been a few weeks since our first performances in the U.S., which were the last with J. Aho on guitar. Early this year J. decided that he will end our shared path here and fully focus on Gorephilia. No hard feelings, only gratitude and respect to J. for the past years. Myriad hails!!!
    <br /><br />Also huge thanks to CDF and Dark Descent for inviting us to the U.S. We had a killer time. Special hails to Matt and the guys from Spectral Voice for your hospitality and help!
    <br /><br />Starting next year J. Lilja will be joining as our new guitarist.
